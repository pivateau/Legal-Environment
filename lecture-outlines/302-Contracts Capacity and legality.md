# Contracts: Capacity and Legality

## Introduction

### Setting

- A valid contract requires offer, acceptance, and consideration
- An otherwise valid contract may sometimes not be enforced
- The parties to a contract must be competent to enter into the contract
- The subject matter of the contract must be legal

### Objective

In this lecture, we look to the requirements of capacity and legality

## Capacity

### Capacity is a legal doctrine used by courts to protect parties who may lack the ability to understand the terms of an agreement

- Minors, mental incompetents, and intoxicated persons may lack the full legal capacity to make legally binding contracts
- Contracts made by the above persons may be voidableâ€”they may be later affirmed or rejected by the person who lacked capacity, but not by the other party

### Minors

- Contracts of minors (persons younger than 18 years of age) are voidable at their option
- Parents are generally not liable for a minor's contract
 
### Minors (ratification and disaffirmance)

- Upon becoming an adult, a party may ratify the agreement
 	- Ratification is the act of accepting and giving legal force to a previously unenforceable obligation
- Disaffirmance: When a contract with a minor has been performed or partially performed, the minor must invoke an action to avoid obligation under the contract

### Mental Competency

- Mental incompetents have a limited capacity to contract
- Mental incompetents include individuals with mental disorders, dementia, or temporary impairment
- Mental incompetents include those who are temporarily incompetent, such as individuals who are severely depressed or under severe or traumatic pressure

### Intoxicated persons

- Intoxication, through drugs or alcohol, can also affect capacity
- Objective Standard: Was the person so intoxicated they couldn't act reasonably?
- If intoxication prevented understanding, the contract may be voidable

## Legality

### For a contract to be enforceable, it must also meet the standard of legality

- Requirement: Contracts must have a lawful object.
- Illegal Contracts: Contracts that violate statutes or public policy are void.
- Public Policy: The community's common sense and conscience regarding morals, health, safety, and welfare.

### Examples of Illegal Contracts

- Unreasonable restraint of trade
- Sale of public office
- Agreements interfering with public duties

### Case discussion: Dorado Beach Hotel Corporation v. Jernigan

### Exceptions to the Nonenforcement Rule

- General rule: courts will not enforce illegal bargains
- Exceptions
  - Protected Parties: Members of a class the law aims to protect may enforce the contract.
  - Repentance and Rescission: A party who rescinds before illegal purpose is carried out may get restitution.
  - Unequal Guilt: If one party was induced by fraud, duress, or economic pressure, they may get restitution.

## Conclusion

### What did we learn today?

- Valid contracts require capacity and legality
- Capacity is a legal doctrine used by courts to protect parties who may lack the ability to understand the terms of an agreement
- Contracts must have a lawful object
