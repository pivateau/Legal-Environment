# The American judicial system

## Introduction

### Setting

- Disputes often arise in business situations
- The judicial system provides the primary means of dispute resolution
- A claim for relief starts with filing a lawsuit in court
- Business managers seeking to resolve disputes must learn legal fundamentals

### Objective

In this lecture, we examine the American court system, as well as legal concepts such as jurisdiction, to gain understanding of how courts work to resolve disputes

## Overview of the judicial system

### The role of the judiciary

- Courts in the US exist to resolve disputes
- Courts in the US play a key role in interpreting and shaping the law
- Courts in the US have the power to review the acts of the legislature to ensure that they are in accordance with a state or the federal constitution.
  - This power is called judicial review

### The United States has a divided court system

- There is a fundamental division between state courts and federal courts
- State courts: Focus on state laws, constitutions, and common law
- Federal courts: Address disputes based on federal laws, the U.S. Constitution, and between citizens of different states

## State courts generally have a three-tier system

### The role of trial courts

- Backbone of the system
- Trial courts determine the **FACTS** of a case
- The jury (or sometimes the judge) is the finder of fact

### There are different kinds of state trial courts

- General jurisdiction courts have broad authority over various cases
- Limited jurisdiction courts have a specialized focus
  - Small claims courts
  - Family courts
  - Probate courts
- Many states have elected state court judges

### Appellate courts

- Hear appeals from trial courts
- Decide matters of **LAW**
- When deciding a case, the appellate court will issue an *opinion*

### An appellate court opinion becomes precedent

- The decision of the appellate court will govern similar disputes in the future
- Trial courts must follow the precedent set by superior appellate courts
- The precedent may only be undone by a superior appellate court (generally the State Supreme Court)

## Federal courts

### Federal courts have limited jurisdiction but are very powerful

- Federal judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate
- Federal judges have lifetime appointments

### Federal courts are also structured in a three-tier system

- US District Courts
- Circuit Courts of Appeals
- The US Supreme Court

### US District Courts

- Every state has at least one US district court
- District courts hear cases involving federal law
- District courts may also hear cases involving citizens of different states

### US Circuit Courts of Appeal

- Intermediate appeals courts
- Geographically divided into 13 circuits
- Hear cases brought by the appellant (the party seeking relief) against the appellee (the party against whom relief is sought)

### US Supreme Court

- Ultimate authority on federal law.
- Limited caseload only hearing relatively few cases each year
- The Supreme Court focuses on significant legal issues.

## Jurisdiction

### Jurisdiction involves the power to hear a case

- There are two aspects to jurisdiction
  - Subject matter jurisdiction: Authority over the dispute itself
  - Personal jurisdiction: Authority over the parties involved

### Subject matter jurisdiction

- State courts: Broad authority over state law issues.
- Federal courts: Limited to federal questions, U.S. involvement, diversity cases.
- Concurrent jurisdiction: When multiple courts have authority.

### Personal jurisdiction

- In-state defendants: Easier to establish
- Out-of-state defendants: Requires long-arm statutes and minimum contacts

## Personal jurisdiction and the concept of minimum contacts

### Minimum Contacts

- Purposeful availment: Defendant's voluntary actions in the forum state.
- Injurious effects: Defendant's actions caused harm within the state.
- Reasonableness: Fair and just to expect the defendant to defend in that state.

### The internet problem

- Case discussion: Zippo
- Sliding scale for evaluating website interactivity:
  - Passive (no jurisdiction)
  - Interactive (case-by-case analysis)
  - Integral to business model (likely jurisdiction)

## Venue

### Venue refers to the appropriate location for the trial to be heard

- Typically determined by
  - where defendant resides or
  - where the events occurred.

## Conclusion

### What did we learn today?

- State courts are the backbone of the judicial system
- Federal courts are powerful but have a limited reach
- Jurisdiction involves the power to hear a case
