# Contracts: Breach and Remedies

## Introduction

### Setting

- Contracts are usually terminated by performance
- Breach of contract occurs when a party fails to perform according to the terms of the contract
- The law provides remedies when a party breaches a contract
- Contractual remedies are designed to put a party in the position he would have been if the contract had performed

### Objective

Today we examine breach of contract and the remedies available to the non-breaching party

## Breach Defined

### When a party to an agreement owes a duty to perform and fails to fulfill a promised obligation, that party has breached the contract

- In cases where the breach is material, it is called a total breach and the nonbreaching (innocent) party is entitled to either suspend performance or be discharged from their obligations completely
- The innocent party is also entitled to sue the breaching party to recover losses suffered due to the breach
- Compensation methods for breach are called remedies

### Material breach

- A material breach is a total breach and the nonbreaching party has the right to suspend performance or may be completely discharged from the contract
- Useful questions to determine whether a breach is material:
  - Does the breach defeat the purpose of the contract?
  - When did the breach occur?
  - Was the breach willful?

## Partial (Simple) Breach

### A breach that is not material

- With a partial breach, the nonbreaching party may not be relieved from performing
- The nonbreaching party may still recover damages related to the breach from the breaching party

## Anticipatory Repudiation (Anticipatory Breach)

- After the parties have entered into an agreement but before performance has occurred, it sometimes becomes apparent that one party does not intend to perform as agreed
- This may be apparent through the party’s words or conduct
- Under certain circumstances, the law provides an avenue of recovery for the nonbreaching party even before the nonperforming party breaches the contract or even before the performance is due
When one party uses unequivocal language to repudiate, the other party may file suit immediately
Any threatened breach must be material, or a total, breach for the nonbreaching party to exercise its right to claim an anticipatory repudiation

### Modern courts have held that repudiation occurs in one of three ways

- A statement by one party indicating an intention not to perform
- An action by the promisor that renders the party’s performance impossible
- Knowledge by the parties that one party may be unable to perform despite both parties’ best efforts

## Monetary Damages (Remedies At Law)

### There are THREE components of monetary damages

- Compensatory damages
- Incidental damages
- Consequential damages

### Duty to mitigate

- The law imposes an obligation on the parties in a contract to take appropriate steps to avoid incurring damages and loss
- If a party can avoid the damages with reasonable effort, without undue risk or expense, they may be barred from recovery through a lawsuit
- The duty to mitigate is the rule preventing recovery for reasonably avoidable damages

## Components of monetary damages

### Compensatory damages compensate the nonbreaching party for the injuries actually sustained

- Cover a broad spectrum of losses for recovery of actual damages suffered by the nonbreaching party
- These damages are an attempt to put the nonbreaching party in the same position they would have been in if the other party had performed as agreed
- In sales contracts, compensatory damages are generally the difference between contract price and market price

### Incidental damages are damages caused by the breach

- Incidental damages are reasonable expenses incurred after a breach
- Incidental damages are those costs incurred as a result of  mitigation

### Consequential damages compensate the nonbreaching party for foreseeable indirect losses not covered by compensatory damages

- An aggrieved party is entitled to recover consequential damages if the damages are caused by unique and foreseeable circumstances beyond the contract itself
- To recover consequential damages, the damages must flow from the breach (i.e., the damages must be a consequence of the breach)

### Liquidated Damages are damages the parties agreed to ahead of time

- In situations where it might be difficult to determine actual damages, parties may agree at the time of the contract that a breach would result in a fixed damage amount
- To be enforceable, a penalty clause (i.e., damages intended to penalize the breaching party rather than compensate the nonbreaching party) cannot be disguised as a liquidated damages clause
- To be enforceable, the amount of harm caused by the breach must be impossible or difficult to estimate
- To be enforceable, the damages must be directly related to the breach and be a reasonable estimate of the actual damages incurred

## Equitable Remedies

### In some cases, money damages are insufficient to compensate the nonbreaching party

- In these cases, a court may grant equitable relief:
  - Specific performance
  - Injunctive relief
  - Reformation

### Specific Performance

- An equitable remedy whereby a court orders the breaching party to render the promised performance by ordering the party to take a specific action
- This remedy is available only when the subject matter of the contract is sufficiently unique that money damages are inadequate
- Examples of circumstances in which specific performance is awarded:
  - Real estate contracts
  - Personal service contracts in which parties agree that a specific individual—who possesses a unique quality or expertise central to the contract—will perform the services

### Injunctive Relief and Reformation

- An injunction is a court order to refrain from performing a particular act
- Reformation: when the parties have imperfectly expressed their agreement and this imperfection results in a dispute, a court may change the contract by rewriting it to conform to the parties’ actual intentions
- The contract modification is the reformation

## Conclusion

### What did we learn today?

- A breach is a party's failure to perform contract duties
- There are two types of breach
- Damages may be calculated
