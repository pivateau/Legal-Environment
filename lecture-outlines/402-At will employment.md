# At will employment

## Introduction

### Setting

* The employment-at-will doctrine is the foundation of American employment law
* Employers can terminate employees with or without cause, and with or without notice
* At the same time, workers are  free to quit their job for any reason, without notice or cause
* There are numerous exceptions to at-will employment

### Objective

* To better understand employment in the US, we study the employment at will doctrine and its numerous exceptions

## Employment at will is rooted in the doctrine of "freedom of contract"

### Most employment contracts of indefinite duration may be terminated at any time

* Employers may terminate employees, even without cause, without incurring liability for breach of contract.
* These indefinite employment contracts constitute terminable-at-will agreements
* The classic restatement of the at-will rule is that an employer may discharge an employee for good cause, for no cause, or even for a bad cause, without being guilty of a legal wrong

### Employment at will is based on state law

* States differ in their approach to employment at will
* Some have very narrow exceptions while others have broader means to avoid the doctrine
* Montana is the only state that does not have at-will employment

## The contract exception to the at-will doctrine may permit an employee to sue for wrongful discharge

### An express employment contract between the parties could alter at-will employment

* The contract may itself specify the duration of the employment, as well as other terms and conditions of employment and termination
* A contract with a defined duration for employment takes the job outside of the doctrine of "at will employment"
* Collective Bargaining Agreements
  * Negotiated by unions, often require "just cause" for termination.

### Employee handbooks as implied contracts

* Quite often, employees will assert that provisions found in an employee handbook created an implied contract
* While most courts in the United States reject this argument, Oklahoma has signaled that sometimes an employee handbook may rise to the level of an employment contract
* Case discussion: Russell v. Board of County Com'rs, Carter County, 1997 OK 80

## Common law protections

### The Public Policy exception

* Oklahoma has a strong public policy exception
* Case discussion: Burk v. Kmart Corp (Okla 1989)
  * In Burk, the Court noted the limits of the at-will doctrine:
    * [T]he terminable-at-will doctrine is "**not** absolute however, and the interests of the people of Oklahoma are **not** best served by a marketplace of cut-throat business dealings where the law of the jungle is thinly clad in contractual lace.‚Äù

### Violation of a statute or executive order

* Public policy is established when a law is violated that protects the public from harm to their health, safety, and welfare.
* Case discussion: Ho v. Tulsa Spine & Specialty HospitaL, 2021 OK 68

### Breach of implied covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing

* Any agreement between the employer and employee includes a promise that the parties will deal with each other fairly and in good faith
* This exception is limited to a small number of states
* Does not exist in Oklahoma

### Breach of implied contract

* An implied contract arises out of the actions of the parties to the agreement
* Employer's actions can create a reasonable expectation of continued employment
* Employers can disclaim, but their conduct must be consistent with the disclaimer

### Promissory estoppel

* Similar to implied contract but is not contractual in nature
* Employee must show that the employer made a promise upon which the worker reasonably relied to her detriment
* Promissory estoppel requires a showing of "detrimental reliance"
* Case discussion: Grouse v. Group Health Plan, Inc., 306 N.W.2d 114 (Minn. 1981)

## Statutory protections

### The employer's ability to terminate the employment relationship is limited by statute

* **Anti-discrimination statutes.** An employer cannot violate anti-discrimination laws
* **WARN statute.** The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN). The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 is a US labor law which protects employees, their families, and communities by requiring most employers with 100 or more employees to provide 60 calendar-day advance notification of plant closings and mass layoffs of employees, as defined in the Act.
* **Retaliation.** An employer cannot terminate an employee in retaliation for exercising statutory rights

### Other federal statutes

* False Claims Act: Protects employees who report fraud against the government.
* Whistleblower Protection Act: Protects federal employees who report illegal or unethical conduct.
* Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA): Protects against retaliation for reporting wage and hour violations.
* Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX): Protects whistleblowers in publicly traded companies.

### State statutes

* Differs from state state to state

## Conclusion

* An employer can make employment decisions that are not based on wrongful grounds
* The law presumes that employees are hired as at will employees
* In recent years the at will doctrine has eroded
