# Business and the Constitution

## Introduction

### Setting

- The US Constitution is the country's foundational document
- The US Constitution is the supreme law of the land
- The US Constitution reduces barriers to commercial activity
  
### Objective

- Today we examine the Constitution and the ways it affects business

## Structure of the Constitution

### Federalism

- The U.S. has a federal system of government consisting of two distinct levels of government—federal and state.
- The Constitution grants exclusive powers to the federal government, concurrent powers shared by the federal government and the states, and powers reserved to the states.

### Separation of powers

- The principle of separation of powers refers to the creation of multiple power centers within a single level of government
- The federal government has three equal components:
  - the legislative branch consists of Congress,
  - the executive branch consists of the President, and
  - the judicial branch consists of the federal courts

## Overview of federal powers

### The Congress (Article I)

- Article I of the Constitution establishes the House of Representatives and the Senate, who have the power to make laws
- Article I delegates a finite and specific set of enumerated powers to Congress

### The President (Article II)

- Article II of the Constitution vests general “executive power” in the president
- These powers include
  - the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces
  - the power to enforce laws made by Congress
  - conduct foreign relations and negotiate treaties with other countries
  - appoint federal judges (subject to Senate approval)

### The Federal courts

- Article III of the Constitution vests judicial power in one Supreme Court and in inferior federal courts established by Congress.
- Judges have the power to interpret laws.
- The doctrine of judicial review, set forth in Marbury v. Madison, is the principle that courts have the implicit authority to invalidate state or federal laws that are in direct conflict with the Constitution

## Origins

### A financial crisis spurred the call for a Constitutional Convention

- The Constitution was adopted to create an economic climate that would enhance stability and security

### The Constitution included key provisions to decrease the barriers to commercial activity

- The Full Faith and Credit Clause provides that states must honor the laws and judicial decisions of other states
- The Privileges and Immunities Clause prevents any state from discriminating against citizens of other states in favor of its own
- The Commerce Clause gives to the federal government the power to regulate national and international business activity

## Regulation of interstate commerce

### Congress has the power to regulate commerce under the "Commerce Clause"

- The Supreme Court has interpreted Congress’s commerce clause power very broadly
- Congress can use its commerce power strategically to regulate almost any aspect of business
- The Supreme Court has also ruled that Congress can regulate purely intrastate conduct  the activity if it produces a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce

### There is a "negative" Commerce Clause effect

- The Commerce Clause not only has a “positive” aspect permitting Congress to regulate interstate and foreign commerce; it also has a “negative” or “dormant” side, limiting the police powers of the states.
- States may not discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce

### The Supreme Court has attempted to impose limits on Congress’s extensive and far-reaching commerce power

- Case discussion: National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius
- Case discussion: U.S. v. Lopez
- Case discussion: U.S. v. Morrison

## The Bill of Rights

### The Bill of Rights refers to the first ten amendments to the Constitution

- It was added to appease opponents to the Constitution who feared that it gave too much power to the federal government
- The Bill of Rights limits federal powers by enumerating state and individual guarantees and rights
- The Bill of Rights was made applicable to the states by the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment

### First Amendment (Freedom of Speech, Assembly, and Religion)

- The First Amendment protects individual liberties in three overlapping domains—religion, speech, and association
- Most of the protections in the Bill of Rights apply against the government, not against private business firms
- The Supreme Court has provided lesser protection for commercial speech than for political speech

### Second Amendment (Arms)

- The Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear weapons
- It has been interpreted as an aŭiliary right supporting the right of self-defense and resistance to oppression and the civic duty to act in defense of one’s country.
- The Supreme Court has interpreted this amendment as protecting an individual’s right to possess and carry firearms (District of Columbia v. Heller).

Third Amendment (Housing of Soldiers)

The Third Amendment prohibits the government from quartering soldiers in private homes without the homeowner’s consent.
It is one of three amendments in the Bill of Rights protecting private property rights (along with the Fourth and Fifth Amendment).

### Fourth Amendment (Search and Seizure)

- The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.
- Searches and seizures are to be conducted only upon issuance of a warrant, judicially sanctioned by “probable cause,” supported by oath or affirmation, and the warrant must particularly describe the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.
- The Exclusionary Rule holds that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment is generally inadmissible in criminal trials.

### Fifth Amendment (Property Rights)

- The Fifth Amendment requires that felonies be tried only upon indictment by a grand jury; it protects individuals from being compelled to be witnesses against themselves in criminal cases; and it prohibits double jeopardy (i.e., acquittals are final).
- Due Process Clause – “nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law”
- Takings Clause - The government may take private property for public use when just compensation is paid to the property owner.
- Just compensation generally means fair market value at the time of the taking.
- Public use has been interpreted as permitting the government to take property on behalf of a private entity as long as the use will benefit the public (Kelo v. City of New London). Prior to this case, public use generally meant for highways, schools, and city buildings.

### Seventh Amendment (Civil Trials)

Civil litigants have a constitutional right to a jury trial.
Common law is a body of law developed by judges that encompasses many traditional areas of law, including property, contract, and torts, just to name a few.
Stare decisis is the principle that like cases should be decided alike (let the decision stand).

### Ninth Amendment (Unenumerated Rights)

- The Ninth Amendment provides that the federal government may not infringe or take away any rights belonging to the people, regardless of whether those rights are specifically listed or enumerated in the Constitution.
- In other words, just because some rights are expressly stated in the Constitution and Bill of Rights as belonging to the people does not mean that the list is exclusive. Individuals may have additional rights even if not mentioned.  

### Tenth Amendment (Federalism and Popular Sovereignty)

- The Tenth Amendment embodies the structural principle of federalism, the idea that the United States contains two separate sources of political power: the states and the federal government.
- Federalism: Those powers not delegated to the federal government are retained by the states.
- Popular sovereignty: Powers not delegated to the government are retained by the people.

## Due Process and Equal Protection

### Due Process

- Both the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution declare that no person shall be deprived “of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”
- Due process means that the procedures followed by the government must be fair.
- Procedural due process requires that any government decision to take life, liberty, or property must be made using fair procedures.
- Substantive due process limits the ability of government to interfere with individual liberty

### Equal Protection

- The Fourteenth Amendment provides that equal protection requires the government to treat people who are similarly situated equally
- The government may create different categories, but each individual in the category must be treated the same
