# Intentional Torts

## Introduction

### Setting

- Tort law is about the obligations that we owe to one another
- People rarely discuss the role of tort law in society
- Tort law defines the duties that we all have, as well as the remedies that are available when we breach those duties

### Objective

In this lecture, we learn about the law of torts and about how it regulates behavior

## A tort is a civil wrong causing loss or harm to another

### The law of torts governs the duties that we owe to others

- People have certain interests that others have the obligation or duty to respect.  
- These interests and the duty of others to respect them does not depend upon promises or agreements
- The violation of the duty to respect the interest is called a "tort"
- Tort law is the body of principles that defines these interests and duties

### Tort law performs three functions

- Compensation of the victim
- Justice
- Prevention of future costs (regulation)

### Tort law is primarily state common law

- The tort rules that we will discuss came out of cases
- Statutory law is not important in the area of torts

## Torts may be classified in different ways

### There are three broad categories of torts

- Intentional Torts: Willful acts causing harm.
- Negligence: Accidental harm due to unreasonable risk creation.
- Strict Liability: Liability regardless of intent, mainly for defective products and abnormally dangerous activities.

## Intentional torts

### Intentional torts require that a defendant intend a harmful or offensive act

- Intentional torts are non-criminal wrongs committed on purpose
- Intent is formed if an action is
  - Purposeful, or
  - Knowing
- The test for intent focuses on whether the tortfeaser intended the act and not the result

## Intentional business-related torts

### Defamation is a publication that injures another's character, reputation, or good name

### Trade Libel/Product Disparagement

- False statements harming a business or product can be a tort

  - Dishonesty: The person who made the statement must have dishonestly made it
  - Harm: The plaintiff must have suffered measurable harm from the misrepresentation

### Negligent Misrepresentation

- A plaintiff must prove the following elements to establish a claim for negligent misrepresentation:
  - False statement: The defendant made a statement about a material fact that they believed to be true but was actually false.
  - Negligently made: The defendant should have known the statement was false.
  - Intended reliance: The defendant intended for the plaintiff to rely on the statement.
