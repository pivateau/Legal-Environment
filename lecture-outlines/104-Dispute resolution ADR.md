# Dispute resolution: Mediation and arbitration

## Introduction

### Setting

- Disputes often arise in business
- Resolving disputes in the court system can be expensive and time-consuming
- Parties may wish to use private means of resolving disputes
- Alternative dispute resolution methods permit a cost-effective resolution

### Objective

In this lecture, we examine alternative dispute resolution methods

## Increasingly, business disputes are decided outside of the court system

- Historically, disputes were heard in the court system
- Beginning in the 1990s, more and more disputes were shifted into private processes

## There are different forms of alternate dispute resolution

- Negotiation is the simplest and least expensive alternative to litigation
- Arbitration, a formal procedure, binds both parties to the result
- Mediation is an informal nonbinding procedure

## Negotiation has advantages and disadvantages

### The parties can negotiate a resolution without the use of third parties

- Advantages: Very inexpensive. Completely confidential. Time-saving. The parties are familiar with the issues and the facts.
- Disadvantages: Parties are locked into their position. Compromise might be interpreted as weakness of conviction. Difficult to comprehend other people’s problems.

## Mediation uses a neutral third party to resolve disputes in an informal procedure

### Mediation is designed to facilitate an early resolution of the dispute

- Generally all disputes are now subject to mediation
- The agreement at dispute may provide for mediation
- Courts will always order a dispute to mediation before trial

### Mediation contains several advantages

- Mediation is a private, confidential, and inexpensive process
- In a mediation, the parties control their fate
- A mediation agreement may be enforced in a court

### Mediation has disadvantages

- Mediation relies on each party having a good faith desire to settle the case
- Mediation does not provide an independent means for the discovery of evidence
- Enforcement of a mediation agreement requires court intervention
- Private resolution of disputes prevents the growth of the common law

## Arbitration is a formal means of alternate dispute resolution

### Arbitration is a technique for the resolution of disputes outside the courts

- The parties to a dispute refer it to arbitration by one or more persons (the “arbitrators”, “arbiters” or “arbitral tribunal”), and agree to be bound by the arbitration decision (the “award”)
- A third party reviews the evidence in the case and imposes a decision that is legally binding on both sides and enforceable in the courts
- There are limited rights of review and appeal of arbitration awards
- Both the agreement to arbitrate and the arbitration award are binding

### Arbitration is widely used in the US for a wide range of cases

- Consumer transactions
- Employment
- Civil rights

### Arbitration is governed by statutes

- The Federal Arbitration Act governs most arbitrations
- Each state generally has an applicable arbitration act

### Arbitration resembles a court case

- The arbitration proceeding is adversarial
- At an arbitration, the parties present evidence and witnesses
- The rules of evidence don't usually apply

### Arbitration is generally a binding procedure

- The arbitration is conducted in front of a neutral third party or parties
- There is generally no appeal of an arbitration award
- Case discussion: [Hall Street Associates, LLC v. Mattel, Inc., 128 S.Ct. 1396 (2008)]
