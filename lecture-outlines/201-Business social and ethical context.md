# Business, Societal, and Ethical Contexts of Law

## Introduction

### Setting

- Ethics consist of moral principles that guide decisions between right and wrong
- Law and ethics are not always aligned
- Businesses may face situations in which an ethical choice is not legal or a legal choice is not ethical
- Guidelines exist to assist businesses in resolving this conflict

### Objective

In this lecture, we examine the complicated relationship between law and ethics and why it matters to businesses

## Solving ethical challenges

### Relationships between business, law, and ethics

- Morals consist of widely accepted standards of right and wrong
- Ethical norms are accepted standards for behavior within a society or community
- Business must confront tension between the moral choice and the legal choice
- Ethical decision-making for long-term business success and societal well-being is vital to survival of a business

## Three approaches to ethics

### Principles-Based Approach

- Based on universal moral principles.

1. Religion

Based on religious principles, such as the Old Testament or the Koran

2. Virtue

Ethical decisions are based on whether the conduct promotes good moral character

3. Natural law

Ethical decisions use reason to ascertain certain rights and moral values which are timeless and universal

4. Duty-based ethics

Based on a sense of duty to human dignity. An action is moral if everyone should act the same way. 

### Consequences-Based Approach

- Focuses on the outcome
- Referred to as utilitarianism
- An ethical choice would be one that provides the greatest good for the greatest number of people with the least harmful consequences to the community

### Case discussion: Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Company

- The problem with utilitarianism

## Corporate social responsibility

### CSR is broader than ethics

- CSR includes social and environmental concerns

### Three views of CSR

- Narrow View: Maximize shareholder value only (Milton Friedman).
- Moderate View: Follow the law, leave social issues to the government.
- Broad View: Good corporate citizenship, consider all stakeholders, triple bottom line (people, planet, profit)

### Case discussion: Brooks Brother Group, Inc. v. Bubbles by Brooks, LLC
