### Constitutional law

- Constitutional law is the foundation for all other law in the United States
- The Constitution  is the supreme law of the land.
- It functions with other laws to
  - (1) establish a structure for the federal and state governments and set rules for amending the constitution;
  - (2) grant specific powers for the different branches of government; and
  - (3) provide procedural protections for U.S. citizens from wrongful government actions.

### Statutory law

- Statutory law is created by a legislative body
  - the U.S. Congress is the exclusive legislative body for the passage of federal law
- A bill is a draft or a proposed federal statute that Congress has not yet passed or the executive has not yet approved.
- At the federal level, the president may sign a bill into law or veto it
  - Congress can override the veto with two-thirds majority vote
- Statutes at local levels are called ordinances
  - generally regulate issues such as zoning or impose health and safety regulations

### Common law

- Common law is the law made by the courts
- Common law is based on a resolution of disputes between parties
- Resolution of the disputes also sets a specific standard for other courts to follow when a similar dispute arises again
- Precedent is when courts apply the law of a previous case to current cases with similar facts

### Administrative law

- Administrative law is the source of law that authorizes the exercise of authority by the executive branch agencies and independent government agencies
- Federal administrative law is largely authorized by statutes and the Constitution, and rules for applying the law are articulated and carried out by administrative agencies.
- Administrative agencies are empowered to administer the details of federal statutes and have broad powers to impose regulations, make policy, and enforce the law in their designated area of jurisdiction.

## Much of American law is derived from English legal doctrines

### Stare decisis

- The doctrine of stare decisis is the principle that similar cases with similar facts and issues should have the same judicial outcome
- The doctrine requires all lower courts to follow the case precedent
- Once an appellate court has decided a particular case, the decision becomes a case precedent
