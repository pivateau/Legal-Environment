# Dispute resolution: Litigation

## Introduction

### Setting

- Disputes often arise in business
- Often disputes can be resolved through informal processes
- If informal negotiations fail, the parties may seek another means of dispute resolution
- The primary means of resolving disputes is called litigation

### Objective

- In this lecture we examine the stages of civil litigation and how disputes are resolved

## Civil litigation as a means of resolving disputes

### Civil litigation is the process of resolving disputes between private parties through the court system

- Civil litigation involves allegations of non-criminal wrongdoing
- Most civil litigants are seeking monetary relief
- Some civil litigants may seek injunctive relief

### The basis for civil litigation

- One party, referred to as the plaintiff, is usually seeking compensation or some other remedy from another party, referred to as the defendant
  - The plaintiff is the party seeking relief
  - The defendant is the party against whom relief is sought

### Types of civil cases include

- personal injury claims
- antitrust litigation
- civil rights
- product liability suits
- employment disputes
- corporate matters
- real estate

### Civil litigation has three basic phases

- Pre-trial
- Trial
- Post-trial

### Pre-trial procedures will consume most time and resources

- Most disputes will be resolved during the pre-trial phase
- Only a very few disputes reach a trial setting
- Even fewer disputes are ever appealed

## Pre-trial: The pleadings stage

### The plaintiff initiates litigation by filing a Complaint

- In state court, the initial document is called a Petition
- A complaint must contain certain elements:
  - statement of jurisdiction,
  - factual allegations,
  - cause(s) of action, and
  - demand for relief

### The defendant responds by filing an Answer

- The defendant must respond to the allegations of the Plaintiff's Complaint
- In federal court, the defendant must respond to each allegation by
  - admitting the fact
  - denying the fact
  - claiming insufficient knowledge

### Counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party complaints

- A counterclaim is a claim for relief by the defendant against the plaintiff
- A cross-claim is a claim brought by a plaintiff against a co-plaintiff, or by a defendant against a co-defendant
- A third-party complaint is a claim by a defendant ("Third-party Plaintiff") against a non-party (now a third-party defendant)

## Pre-trial: The discovery stage

### The pre-trial stage is meant to narrow issues

- The trial court's function is to determine the facts
- During the pre-trial stage, the parties try to determine which facts are in dispute
- The parties will typically amend their pleadings as more facts are revealed

### Discovery is the process of gathering information to prepare for trial

- Discovery is the legal process that lets each side of a suit ask the other side for information that is related to the case
- During discovery, each party must show the other side evidence they plan to use during trial
- Certain disclosures (Initial Disclosures) are automatically required in every case

### Scope of discovery

- Discovery requests can include asking for documents, tangible things, or information about people who have knowledge of relevant matters
- Generally, a party may ask for any information that is not privileged and is relevant to the lawsuit
- Evidence is relevant if it has a tendency to prove a fact and that fact is important in the lawsuit

### Primary means of discovery

- Depositions: Sworn testimony under oath
- Interrogatories: Written questions to the opposing party
- Document requests: Requests for documents, emails, etc.

## Pre-trial: The motions stage

### Either party may file motions during the pre-trial stage

- Motion to Compel Discovery
- Motion to Dismiss
- Motion for Summary Judgment

## Trial stage

### A trial may be tried to a judge

- Non-jury trial: The judge will serve as the finder of fact
- Generally referred to as a "bench trial"
- Plaintiffs will generally seek a jury trial, but the parties can agree to a bench trial

### A trial may involve use of a jury

- Jury Selection (*Voir Dire*): The process of selecting a jury
- Opening Statements: Outlining case for jury

### The trial proceeds in stages

- Presentation of Evidence: Direct and cross-examination.
- Closing Arguments: Last opportunity to appeal to the jury
- Jury Instructions and Deliberation: The judge provides instructions to the jury
- Verdict: The verdict will set out damages (special, general, or punitive)

## Post-trial stage

### Either party may file post-trial motions

- Motion for a New Trial
- Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict (JNOV)

### Either party may appeal to a court of appeals

- An appeal involves its own rules and procedures
- An appeal is a legal argument presented to a panel of appellate judges on issues of law
- The appellate court searches for any errors in legality made during the pre-trial or trial proceedings
- After reviewing the proceedings, the appellate court releases an opinion, which is the appellate courtâ€™s decision

### After hearing arguments an appellate court can do one of three things

- It can affirm the judgment of the lower court, in which case the decision of the lower court remains unchanged
- The appellate court can also reverse the judgment of the lower court in part or entirely
- Remand the case to the trial court for further action in light of the appellate court's finding

## Conclusion

### What did we learn today?

- Civil litigation is the process of resolving disputes between private parties through the court system
- Civil litigation has three basic phases
- Litigation is expensive and time-consuming
