# Employment discrimination

## Introduction

### Setting

* The employment at will doctrine does not apply to illegal discrimination
* Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 governs illegal discrimination in employment
* Despite laws against discrimination, employment litigation continues to grow
* Understanding Title VII is vital for all managers

### Objective

* In this lecture, we get an overview of antidiscrimination laws and how they are applied

## What does Title VII do?

### Title VII protects against employment discrimination on the basis of membership in protected classes

* Title VII protects five classes
* Title VII protects individuals against employment discrimination on the bases of race and color
* Title VII protects individuals against employment discrimination on the bases of national origin, sex, and religion

### What does Title VII say?

* It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer
* to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual ... because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin ...

### Title VII's protections include the following

* Employment requirements must be uniformly and consistently applied
* Title VII prohibits offensive conduct that alters the conditions of employment
* Title VII prohibits discrimination in compensation
* Title VII prohibits physical segregation based on protected class
* Title VII protects employees who make a complaint from retaliation

## Title VII permits an employee to sue in court for illegal discrimination

### There are two different theories on which an employee can base a claim of illegal discrimination

* Disparate treatment involves a policy or action that is discriminatory on its face
* Disparate impact involves policies that are neutral on their face, but which have a negative impact on a protected class

## Disparate treatment is used for cases of discrimination against an individual rather than a group

### The employee must prove a prima facie case

* The prima facie case gives rise to a presumption of unlawful discrimination
* There are four elements to a prima facie case
  * Plaintiff belongs to a protected class
  * Plaintiff applied for and was qualified for the job
  * Plaintiff was rejected for the position
  * An employee outside of the protected class was selected for the position, or the employer continued to look for candidates

### The employer has defenses

* The employer rebuts the prima facie case by showing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason (LNDR).
  * The plaintiff can then establish that the LNDR is actually a pretext to hide unlawful discrimination

### An employer may also establish a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ) defense for certain disparate treatment cases

* BFOQ is available only for disparate treatment cases involving sex, religion and national origin
* A BFOQ is legalized discrimination
* The employer must show that this preference goes to the essence of its business

## Disparate impact exists where an employer has a policy that is neutral on its face but has a negative impact upon a protected category

### Disparate impact relates to groups and not individuals

* Disparate impact regulates the use of screening devices
* Disparate impact can make an employer liable even for non*intentional discrimination

### There are several methods for establishing a prima facie case of disparate impact

* The plaintiff must prove a prima facie case (generally using statistics)
* The plaintiff can show that the protected employees do not fare at least 80% as well as the majority under the policy
* The 80% rule states that the selection rate of the protected class should be at least 80% of the selection rate of the other class.

### After the plaintiff makes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer

* The employer rebuts by attacking the plaintiff's statistics
* The employer can also rebut by establishing that the screening device is a business necessity
  * The screening device is necessary for its business
  * The screening device accurately measures for the quality that is sought

## Other important antidiscrimination laws

### Federal antidiscrimination statutes

* Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA): Protects employees over 40.
* Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA):
* Equal Pay Act (EPA): Prohibits unequal pay for equal work based on sex.

### Every state has its own version of Title VII

* In Oklahoma, we have the Oklahoma Anti-Discrimination Act
* State laws may have greater protection than federal laws

## Conclusion

### What did we learn today?

* Title VII protects against employment discrimination on the basis of membership in protected classes
* There are two theories of discrimination
* There are other state and federal antidiscrimination laws
*
