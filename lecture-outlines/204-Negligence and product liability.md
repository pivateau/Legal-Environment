# Negligence and product liability

## Introduction

### Setting

- Tort law provides much regulation in our society
- The law of negligence plays a huge role in our life, whether we know it or not
- Because of its importance, the law of negligence requires special scrutiny

### Objective

- Today we examine negligence law and the elements of a negligence claim

## Negligence is the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid injury to others

### A negligent party fails to act as a reasonable person would act in similar circumstances

- Negligence law protects individuals against harmful acts of other members of society
- Negligence requires no intent on the part of the tortfeasor
- Negligence may include liability for a failure to act

### Negligence is composed of five elements

- The defendant had a **duty of care**
- The defendant **breached** the duty of care
- The defendant’s conduct was a **cause-in-fact** of plaintiff’s injuries
- The defendant’s conduct was the legal (or **proximate**) cause of plaintiff’s injuries
- The plaintiff suffered actual **damages**

## Duty of care

### A duty of care is a legal obligation to act reasonably

- Duty of care: A person is under a duty to all others to exercise reasonable care for physical safety or property
- A duty of care arises in three different situations
  - A duty of care exists if the victim was among those who would foreseeably be at risk of harm from the actor’s conduct
  - A duty of care exists if a special relationship exists between the defendant and the plaintiff
  - A duty of care exists if a statute or regulation provides for one

### No duty to rescue

- Generally, there is not a duty to act or rescue (unless assumption of duty)

### Case Study: James v. Meow Media, Inc

## Breach

### If the defendant failed to act as a reasonable person would act, it creates a breach of the duty of care

- The reasonable person standard establishes the standard of care
- A party must act as a reasonably prudent person would under similar circumstances
- A plaintiff in a negligence case must prove that the defendant did not act as a reasonable person would have

### Other aspects of breach

- *Negligence per se* results from violation of safety statutes
- *Res Ipsa Loquitur*
  - The thing speaks for itself, inferring negligence from circumstances

## Causation

### A defendant is not liable just because of the breach of the duty of care

- Causation is composed of two elements
- One must prove actual cause, known as cause in fact
- One must also prove legal cause, known as proximate cause

### Cause in fact refers to but for causation

- Cause in fact is an act (or omission) without which the plaintiff’s injury would not have occurred
- Two parties can both be the cause-in-fact of an injury
- Causation can be established if the act or omission is a substantial factor

### Proximate cause requires that the negligent act be closely related to the injury

- Question: Are the cause and harm closely enough related to find liability?
- The most important factor in determining proximate cause is foreseeability
- If a harm is not foreseeable, there is no proximate cause

### Case discussion: Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co., 162 N.E. 99 (N.Y. 1928)

## Damages

### A plaintiff must suffer actual damages

- Must prove physical harm and resulting losses to recover

## Defenses to Negligence

### Means of reducing liability

- Contributory Negligence: Plaintiff's own negligence bars recovery.
- Comparative Negligence: Damages apportioned based on fault.
- Assumption of Risk: Plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily accepted the risk of harm.

## A business may be liable for defective products regardless of fault

### Elements

- Product was defective.
- Defect existed when it left the defendant's control.
- Defect caused the plaintiff's injury.

### Types of Defects

- Design defects
- Manufacturing defects
- Marketing defects (failure to warn)

### Defenses

- Misuse of the product
- Assumption of risk
- Comparative negligence

## Conclusion

### What did we learn today?

- Negligence is the failure to act reasonably
- There are five elements of negligence
- A business may be liable for defective products regardless of fault
