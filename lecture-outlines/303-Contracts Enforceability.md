# Contracts: Enforceability

## Introduction

### Setting

- If the parties have formed a valid contract, the legal analysis turns to the issue of enforceability
- Enforceability gives contracts meaning
- A contract must be the product of genuine assent
- Sometimes a contract must be in writing

### Objective

In this lecture, we examine the requirements necessary to enforce a valid contract

## Consent

### The parties to a contract must voluntarily consent to the contract

- There are five instances in which genuine assent may be lacking
- If genuine assent is missing, no contract is formed

### Five Instances

- Misrepresentation;
- Fraud;
- Duress;
- Undue influence; and
- Unconscionability

### Misrepresentation

- In general, misrepresentation occurs when one party to an agreement makes a promise or representation about a material fact that is not true

### The common law recognizes two types of misrepresentation

- Negligent misrepresentation
- Fraudulent misrepresentation

### Negligent misrepresentation

- A misrepresentation can occur even if the misrepresenting party does not actually know that the promise or representation is false

### For a party to avoid a contract based on negligent misrepresentation

- The misrepresentation was material;
- Reliance on the misstatement when forming the agreement; and
- The misrepresentation was one of fact

### Case study: Vokes v. Arthur Murray, Inc

### Fraudulent misrepresentation

- A contract is voidable if it was based on fraud
- Fraud affects the nature of the assent given by the contracting party
- A party who agrees to a contract containing fraudulent terms did not give genuine assent

### Misrepresentation requires certain elements

- A party misrepresents a material fact
- with the intent to deceive an innocent party
- on which the innocent party justifiably relied
- resulting in injury to the innocent party

## Additional contract defenses

### The common law recognizes several other contract defenses, including

^ All these contract defenses manifest ways in which genuine assent might be lacking during the formation stage of a contract

1. Duress;
2. Undue Influence; and
3. Unconscionability

### Duress

- If one party to a contract uses any form of unfair coercion to induce another party to enter or modify a contract, the coerced party may avoid the contract based on duress

### Generally, the law recognizes three categories of duress

- Violence or threats of a violent act;
- Economic threats (such as wrongful termination or threats to breach a contract); and
- Threats of extortion (or other threats whereby the other party has no meaningful choice)

### Undue Influence

- Grants legal relief to a party who has been induced to enter a contract through the improper pressure of a trusted relationship

### Undue influence allows the influenced party to avoid a contract

- when the court determines that the terms of the contract are unfair
- and the parties had some type of relationship that involved a fiduciary duty or some duty to care for the influenced party

### Unconscionability

- The defense of unconscionability gives the court the tools to refuse to enforce a contract where the consideration is grossly unequal

### Adhesion contracts are generally enforceable

- Standardized, preprinted contracts can cause suspicion
- Courts may scrutinize adhesion contracts to determine if they are unconscionable or unfair

### Case discussion: Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co

## Statute of Frauds

### This rule prevents fraud by requiring written evidence of certain contracts

- Sale of land
- Contracts not performable within one year
- Debt of another
- Marriage consideration
- Executor's promise to pay estate debts

### Oral contracts are valid contracts, unless they fall within the Statute of Frauds

- The Statute of Frauds is a defense, not a requirement for all contracts

## Contract Interpretation and the Parol Evidence Rule

### The parol evidence rule prohibits consideration of evidence outside of the contract

- Bars evidence of prior or contemporaneous agreements that contradict a final written contract
- Exceptions:
 	- Evidence clarifying ambiguous terms
 	- proving fraud

### Other aspects of contract interpretation

- Ambiguous Terms: Construed against the drafter
- Trade usage: A practice or method that is regularly observed within a trade
- Missing Terms: Courts may supply reasonable terms

### Case Study: Professional Bull Riders, Inc. v. AutoZone, Inc

## Conclusion

### What did we learn today?

- A valid contract requires consent
- Misrepresentation may void a contract
- The Statute of Frauds requires some contracts to be in writing
