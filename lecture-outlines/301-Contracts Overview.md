# Contracts: Overview, Assent, and Consideration

## Introduction

### Setting

- A contract is a legally enforceable promise
- Contracts are vital for protecting expectations, facilitating planning, and enabling transactions
- Contracts form the basis for modern society

### Objective

Today we look at the nature of a contract and the requirement for agreement and consideration

## Importance of contracts

### The Constitution protects the right to contract

- Article I, Section 10 limits the ability of the government to interfere with contracts
- Much of American history has been based on the legal doctrine of "freedom of contract"

### Sources of contract law

- Common law
  - services
  - real estate
- Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)
  - sale of goods
- Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG)
  - international sale of goods

## Elements of a valid contract

### A valid contract has four basic required elements

- Mutual Assent: Offer and acceptance
- Consideration: Mutual exchange of benefits and detriments
- Legality of Purpose: The contract must not violate the law
- Capacity: The parties must be legally capable of entering a contract

### Contracts can be described as

- Valid – a contract with all the required elements
- Void – an agreement which lacks a required element of a valid contract or was not formed in accordance with the law
- Voidable – one or more parties have the right to cancel an otherwise valid contract
- Unenforceable - a valid contract that cannot be enforced by the court because of a legal defense

### There are different types of contracts

- By Contractual Commitment: Bilateral vs. Unilateral
- By Source of Law: Common Law vs. UCC
- By Level of Explicitness: Explicit vs. Implied
- By Business Relationship: Transactional vs. Relational

## Mutual assent

### Mutual assent is made up of offer and acceptance

- Offer is a promise or commitment to do (or refrain from doing) a specified activity
- Requirements of a Valid Offer:
  - Objective intent
  - Clear and definite terms
  - Communication to the offeree
  
### Case Study: Lucy v. Zehmer (objective intent)

### Advertisements as Offers

- Generally not offers, but invitations to make an offer
- There are a few exceptions

## Termination of an offer

### An offer can terminate because of the actions of the parties

- Revocation
- Rejection
- Counteroffer

### An offer can generally be revoked at any time before acceptance

- Express communication by offeror to revoke (withdraw) the offer
  - or an inconsistent act that would give reasonable notice to the offeree that the offer no longer exists
- An offer is irrevocable if it is an option to enter into a contract
  - This holds open the offer for a set time

### Rejection of an offer terminates the offer

- An offer is terminated when the offeree rejects it
- The mirror image rule requires that the offeree’s acceptance may not even slightly alter the terms of the original offer

### Counteroffer

- A counteroffer is a rejection plus new offer
- A counteroffer terminates the original offer and makes a new offer even if there is only a slightly change in terms from the original offer

## An offer can terminate by operation of law

### Even without acts of the parties, the following may terminate the offer

- Lapse of time
- Death or incapacity of the offeror or offeree
- Destruction of the contract’s subject matter before acceptance
- Supervening illegality

## Acceptance

### Acceptance is a voluntary act that shows agreement to the terms of an offer

- Acceptance is an offeree's agreement to the terms of the offer
- Offeror has the power to terminate the offer, modify its terms, or prescribe the method of acceptance until the offer is accepted by the offeree

### Mailbox rule

- The mailbox rule states that an acceptance is valid once it is sent
- An acceptance is effective upon dispatch, while a revocation becomes effective upon receipt

## Consideration

### Consideration is something of legally sufficient value given in return for a promise

- Definition: The bargained-for exchange of benefits and detriments
- There must be a bargained-for exchange
- Forbearance (giving up a legal right) can be consideration

### Consideration consists of a legal detriment

- Doing or promising something not one is not legally obligated to do
- Courts generally don't assess the fairness of the exchange

### Preexisting Duty Rule

- If a party does or promises to do what they are already legally obligated to do,
 	- the law generally does not recognize this as a legal detriment
- Thus, the contract is unenforceable

### Illusory promises lack consideration

- Deathbed promises made to comfort the dying.
- Promises of a gift.
- Promises of love and friendship.
- Promises that by their terms are not binding.

### Past Consideration

- A promise made in return for a detriment previously made by the promise
- Not sufficient to create a valid contract

## Promissory Estoppel

### Under the theory of promissory estoppel, a relying party may recover damages if

- The promisor makes a promise that is reasonable
- The promise actually relied on the promise and suffered an injury
- The promise’s reliance was reasonably foreseeable to the promisor

## Conclusion

### What did we learn today?

- Contracts are important to businesses
- A valid contract requires offer, acceptance, and consideration
- Justifiable reliance on a promise may provide a path for reliance damages
