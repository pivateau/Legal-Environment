## Vicarious liability

### Sometimes the liability of an agent can pass through to the principal

- The fundamental principle of agency law holds that a principal should be held responsible for the actions of their agent when those actions are taken on behalf of the principal

- A principal can be held vicariously liable for the actions of an agent acting within the scope of their authority

### An employer can be liable for the wrongful acts of its employee

- *Respondeat superior* applies to the employer-employee relationship within the framework of agency
- This doctrine holds the employer (principal) liable for the torts (wrongful acts) committed by the employee (agent) while acting within the scope of their employment
- This is because the employee is considered to be acting on behalf of the employer when performing their job duties
