# Contracts: Performance

## Introduction

### Setting

- At some point, the parties must be able to identify when the contract’s obligations and rights have terminated
- The termination of a party’s obligations under a contract is called discharge
- Discharge occurs in different ways
- The parties can perform or the parties can be released from performance

### Objective

Today we look at performance and discharge of a contract

## Discharging Obligations Through Performance

### Parties to a contract must perform

- Generally, parties agree on contractual terms and perform their obligations in good faith to complete the contract
- Performance occurs when the parties do what they promised
- Both parties discharge their obligation to the other by performing their agreed-upon duties

### Assignment

- Assignment occurs when one of the contracting parties transfers their rights to another party
- The original party with duties under the contract must still perform as required under the contract

## Substantial performance

### Substantial performance occurs when a party substantially fulfills a contractual obligation

- If a party substantially performs, the contract remains in force and the other party must perform
- The law allows substantial performance to satisfy the requirements of the agreement and trigger the other party’s obligation to perform

### Prevailing in a substantial performance case

- The party trying to enforce the contract must show that they acted in good faith and that deviation from the required performance was not material
- "Material" refers to deviation from the contract such that the the performance altered a fundamental aspect of the agreement

### The nonbreaching party may recover its damages

- The doctrine of substantial performance allows a party to meet their obligations in a contract even though performance was less than perfect
- The nonbreaching party may still collect damages to compensate for the imperfect performance
- Courts allow the substantially performing party to be paid the full amount of the contract price (or other performance due) less any costs suffered

### Case discussion: Jacob & Youngs v. Kent, 129 N.E. 889 (Court of Appeals of New York 1921)

## Parties may agree to mutually terminate their original contract

### Parties may terminate their agreement using any of the following methods

- Rescission
- Accord and satisfaction
- Substitute agreement
- Novation

## Rescission

### If neither party has fully performed, the parties may agree to cancel the contract

- Each party gives up rights under the contract in exchange for the release by the other party from performing their obligations
- Rescission occurs only if both parties agree to rescind
- A unilateral rescission (by only one party) is not permitted

## Accord and Satisfaction

### In some cases, the parties to a contract agree to accept performance that is different from the originally promised performance

- Under the doctrine of accord and satisfaction, one party agrees to substitute performance in the future (known as accord),
- and the other party promises to accept that substitute performance in discharge of the existing performance obligation

### Once the substitute performance has been rendered, this acts as a satisfaction of the obligation

- Discharge of the obligation occurs only when the terms of the accord are performed
- If the accord performance is not rendered, the other party has the option to recover damages either under the original contract or under the accord contract

### Case discussion: McMahon Food Corp. v. Burger Dairy Co

## Discharge By Mutual Agreement: Substitute Agreement

### Contracting parties may discharge their obligations by replacing the original contract with a substitute agreement

- The substitute agreement is generally used to compromise when two parties have a dispute as to performance of the contract and wish to amend its terms
- The substituted agreement immediately discharges any obligations under the original contract

## Novation

### When the parties agree to substitute a third party for one of the original parties to the contract, the agreement may be discharged through novation

- A novation is a kind of substitute agreement that involves a substitute third party rather than a substitute promise
- A novation revokes and discharges all the replaced party’s obligations under the old contract

## Discharge By Operation of Law

### In some cases, unexpected events occur that affect one party’s ability to perform

- The law may allow the parties to be excused from performance under the contract

### Three doctrines permit discharge by operation of law

- Impossibility
- Impracticability
- Frustration of purpose

## Impossibility

### Impossibility must be objective

- In other words, a reasonable person would consider the obligation impossible to perform rather than
- subjective (one party decides unilaterally that performance is impossible for the obligation to be discharged)

### The modern trend of courts is against allowing impossibility as a defense unless if fits into one of four intervening events

- Destruction of the subject matter
- Death or incapacitation of one of the parties to the contract
- The means of performance contemplated in the contract cannot be performed
- Performance of the obligation has become illegal after the contract but before performance

## Impracticability

### To prevail on a claim of impracticability, a party must generally show that

* An unforeseen event occurred
- The event made performance impracticable
- The nonoccurrence of the event was not foreseeable when the contract was made
- The event was not the party's fault
- The parties assumed the event would not occur

### Force majeure

- Sometimes parties add a clause that contemplates uncontrollable acts that will impede performance under the contract.
- These clauses are referred to as force majeure, or act of God, clauses
- Riots, pandemics such as Covid-19, threats of terrorism, fires, earthquakes, wars, and embargoes are often mentioned in these clauses as events that will discharge the duties of the parties

## Conclusion

### What did we learn today?

- At some point, the parties must be able to identify when the contract’s obligations and rights have terminated
- The termination of a party’s obligations under a contract is called discharge
- Discharge occurs in different ways
